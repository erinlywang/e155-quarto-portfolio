    "text": "Reflections on Lab\nThe lab was definitely difficult with learning how to use Radiant instead of Quartus Prime. I also found it tricky understanding how to program the blinking LED2 using the counter.\nI feel a lot more confident in understanding what is going on in a testbench program because before in E85 it seemed like somewhat of a black box to me.\nI’m still struggling with figuring out how to separate modules and writing testbenches for modules that don’t require a testvector file. I would like to continue strengthening my ability to write new modules and testbenches for those modules in a way that works in the overall top module. The trickiest module for this was trying to separate the clock divider for the blinking LED2 into another module. I ended up not doing a separate module because the code worked really well in the top module and I ran out of time.\nIf I have more time I would like to go back and retry making an led_blinker module that can have the HSOSC module outside of the led_blinker module and feed the internal clock int_osc into the blinking led module."

    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\n\nDual Display with one 7-Segment Module\nIn order to display two independent hexadecimal numbers on the dual 7-segment display using only one sevseg module, the trick was to send the same output to both digits but alternate between turning on the first digit and the second digit fast enough that the different digits are seen at the same time to our eyes (~60 Hz). To alternate between the two, the on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz then a counter was used to divide the high frequency clock signal into a 60 Hz signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The calculation for the counter to make the inputs and output powers alternate at 60 Hz.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 1 derived that the counter needed to reach 200000 before setting the multiplexer select HIGH in order switch between the two inputs and turning on the two outputs at 60 Hz. For example, if the first digit should read 1 and then second digit should read 5, then when clk is LOW, the program takes 1 as the input and sends 1 to both digits’ outputs. Then, the program turns only the first digit’s power on and turns the other digit’s power off. When clk is HIGH, the program takes 5 as the input and sends 5 to both digits’ outputs. Then the program turns the second digit’s power on and turns the first digit’s power off. This switch happens fast enough that the human eye sees both individual digits on the display.\n\n\nResistor choice for 7-segment Display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The calculation for the 7-segment current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 1.9V from the MAN4600 datasheet.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 2 derived 1kΩ as an appropriate resistor to provide ~1.2 mA to the LED segments of the 7-segment display. The drop in voltage from the emitter is due to the emitter saturation voltage. Thus the voltage going into the segment displays is 3.1 V.\n\n\nResistor choice for transistors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The calculation for the transistor current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 0.7V for the emitter diode such that the base voltage is 2.6V.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 3 derived 2.7kΩ as an appropriate resistor (stock-room available) to provide less than 1 mA to FPGA I/O pins.\n\n\nResistor choice for keypad inputs\nIn order to read the keypad keys, I chose to have my columns as one of my top module’s outputs. This means my program drives power to the columns and checks the rows for a press. I also chose to implement an active HIGH keypad, which means I needed pulldown resistors for the row inputs such that when there is no activity, the rows read 4'b0000. I chose 680Ω as the resistors to be large enough so as to not draw too much current from the FPGA pins and small enough to quickly pull down the signal and act as a pulldown resistor.\n\n\nDebounce design and FSM diagrams\nOne of the mechanical issues with the keypad buttons is that the buttons “bounce” when pressed. I chose to debounce my keypad buttons using an 3-state FSM that waits for a button to be pressed, then when the button was pressed the FSM would enter a state that waits for a counter to reach high enough that the button would have stabilized, then when the counter reaches a set number the FSM would enter a state that waits for the button to be released.\n \nThe images above detail the design of the three FSMs that I used in my overall implementation. One FSM was to switch between scanning for rows and holding when a key was pressed (?@fig-scanfsm). Another FSM was the debouncing FSM to only register the keypress once (?@fig-tbdebdigfsm). And the digit FSM was for switching between updating the digits and not updating the digits (?@fig-tbdebdigfsm). The FSM is a simple strategy to store an input in “memory” and use this memory to decide what to do at the next clock cycle. However, some of the tradeoffs with the FSM is that the inputs and timing can get really tricky especially in this lab where multiple FSMs needed to communicate with each other."

The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts\n\n\n\nThe design met all intended design objectives. Figure 7 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the top module’s testbench tb_top. Because all the outputs depend on HSOSC it can be assumed that HSOSC toggles. As shown in Figure 7, the simulated outputs of seg change when expected in relation to the led0 which holds the value for whether the button is debounced and counter from the mpx module which updates what key to send to the seg module. seg is expected then to change after the button is debounced (db/counter reaches 500000) and the mpx sends seg the key to output (db/mpx reaches 200000). I wrote tests for all 16 keys that seg matches expected for when the button is pressed, when another button is pressed while the first one is still pressed, and when the button is released. Although not pictured, the testbench passed all tests for all 16 keys.\n\n\nscanner Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Testbench simulation results for scanner module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows that the scanner module reaches all scanning states when no row is input and reaches all pressed states when a row is input at the corresponding column. At the end of the simulation, the image shows that the scanner module also correctly stays in the PRESSED state even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held.\n\n\ndebouncer Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Testbench simulation results for debouncer module. The simulation shows the correct states as expected with the set inputs.\n\n\n\nFigure 9 shows that the debouncer module moves from S0 (waiting for key press) to S1 when a key is registered and correctly stays in the S1 state of waiting for debounced to go high (counter to reach 500000) even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Testbench simulation results for debouncer module. The simulation shows the correct states as expected with the set inputs.\n\n\n\nFigure 10 shows that the debouncer module moves from S1 (waiting for debounced) to S2 when debounced goes high and stays in the S2 state of waiting for the button to be released even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held. The FSM also correctly moves back to S0 when the button is released (row input is 4'b0000). debounced also correctly goes high after the counter counts up to 500000.\n\n\nsynchronizer Module\n ?@fig-tbsync shows that the synchronizer module correctly transfers the asynchronous input to the synchronized output after 4 clock cycles. The choice of 4 clock cycles was for the synchronized output to match the right SCANNING state in the scanner module, and there are 4 scanning states to run through in the scanning cycle.\n\n\ndigit Module\n ?@fig-tbdigit shows that the digit module visits all 3 states. The module correctly does not transfer any information when in the NOUPDATE state and correctly transfers the most recent input only to the right row/col and updates the left row/col with the previous values of the right row/col in the UPDATE state. The module also correctly only updates the right and left rows/cols by moving to the FINISHEDUPDATE state after updating once as well as returns to NOUPDATE when the debounced signal goes back to 0 (debouncer module is back to waiting for a button to be pressed).\n\n\nkeypad Module\n ?@fig-tbkeypad shows that the keypad module correctly matches a row and column pair to its corresponding key on the 4x4 keypad.\n\n\nsevseg Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Testbench simulation results for the sevseg module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all testvectors\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the sevseg module’s testbench tb_sevseg. The simulated outputs of seg match the expected outputs.\n\n\nmpx Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Testbench simulation results for the mpx module for before the flip. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts\n\n\n\nFigure 12 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the mpx module’s testbench tb_mpx to test that the s, trans0, and trans1 output matches the expected outputs for before the alternation (aka flip) at counter = 200000. Because we are before the flip, s should be the same as the s0 input and trans0 and trans1 should be 0 and 1 respectively. The simulated outputs of mpx match the expected outputs for before the flip and the counter is counting up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Testbench simulation results for the mpx module for after the flip. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all testvectors\n\n\n\nFigure 13 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the mpx module’s testbench tb_mpx to test that the s, trans0, and trans1 output matches the expected outputs for after the alternation (aka flip) that should occur when the counter reaches 200000. Because we are after the flip, s should be the same as the s1 input and trans0 and trans1 should be 1 and 0 respectively. The simulated outputs of mpx match the expected outputs for after the flip and the flip happens when the counter reaches 200000. The reset of the counter after count reaches 200000 is also visualized."

The design has no latchesor tristate buffers. The design also uses synchronizers and only registers the first button press if additional buttons are pressed down while holding down one button. There is no bleeding between the digits or flickering and the 7-segment display does not dim depending on which numbers are displayed. The digits are also upright to the viewer.\nOverall a success!"

    "text": "AI Prototype and Reflection\nThe first run with Claude AI produced a code very similar to the one I had written for the led_blinker by toggling the led under an always_ff statement with the counter. Some key differences was that the program used the SB_HFOSC module rather than the HSOSC which was new to me and was also unrecognized by Radiant giving a “instantiating unknown module” error.\nAfter feeding the error back into the LLM, the LLM fed back to declare the primitive with blackbox attribute which is also completely new to me. However parsing this still provided an error that CLKHF_DIV is not defined in this module. The instantiation of the SB_HFOSC module seemed to run into an error where the parameter in the module was not defined when later used in the module.\nAnother key difference and something new to me was that the program used localparam int to initialize a maximum counter and the width of the counter. The width of the counter used the code $clog2(COUNTER_MAX + 1) which I have never seen.\nIf I were to use the LLM again, I would like to tell the LLM what modules to use. The issue seemed to be with SB_HFOSC so feeding the LLM explicitly to use HSOSC could be quicker to getting towards a working code. Doing this actually changed the error to duplicate module name because the LLM program was trying to delcare the HSOSC primitive. Then feeding this error the LLM replied that the error is likely due to the HSOSC module already being available and it deleted the primitive declaration. After this deletion the code synthesized with no errors!\nI think the quality of the output is quite high. Each new section of code is commented with an overarching comment of the module’s function at the top. The only thing is that the LLM can get really stuck on executing the code one way and sometimes better quality code can be written by knowing multiple avenues of which to implement the code. So feeding the desired packages or modules can be really helpful in producing successful LLM code."

This switch happens fast enough that the human eye sees both individual digits on the display.\n\n\nResistor choice for 7-segment Display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The calculation for the 7-segment current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 1.9V from the MAN4600 datasheet.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 2 derived 1kΩ as an appropriate resistor to provide ~1.2 mA to the LED segments of the 7-segment display. The drop in voltage from the emitter is due to the emitter saturation voltage. Thus the voltage going into the segment displays is 3.1 V.\n\n\nResistor choice for external LEDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The calculation for the external LEDs current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 1.9V from the green LED datasheet.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 3 derived 1kΩ as an appropriate resistor to provide ~1.4 mA to the external LEDs. The calculation is the same as for the 7-segment display, however the cathodes of the LEDs are connected to ground rather than to a pin.\n\n\nResistor choice for transistors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The calculation for the transistor current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 0.7V for the emitter diode such that the base voltage is 2.6V.\n\n\n\nThe calculation in Figure 4 derived 2.7kΩ as an appropriate resistor (stock-room available) to provide less than 1 mA to FPGA I/O pins."

An internal 100 kΩ pullup resistor was used to ensure the active low reset pin for the switches was not floating.

Note that not all the tested inputs of led are shown in this image. The outputs of top: seg, trans0, and trans1 are not tested in this testbench because they rely on the mpx module which uses the HSOSC clock to provide the transistor output and switch input into sevseg. The outputs for seg are tested in the sevseg testbench while trans0 and trans1 and the switch input into sevseg are tested in the mpx testbench.\n\n\nsevseg Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Testbench simulation results for the sevseg module.

Because we are after the flip, s should be the same as the s1 input and trans0 and trans1 should be 1 and 0 respectively. The simulated outputs of mpx match the expected outputs for after the flip and the flip happens when the counter reaches 200000. The reset of the counter after count reaches 200000 is also visualized."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe design successfully displayed two individual digits on the dual 7-segment display using only one sevseg module. The 5 LEDs also successfully display the sum of the two inputs. There is no bleeding between the digits or flickering and the 7-segment display does not dim depending on which numbers are displayed. The digits are also upright to the viewer."

    "text": "AI Prototype and Reflection\n\nWithout Lab 1 Files Provided\nOff the bat I already recognized the Claude Ai put multiple modules in one file and the testbench module in another file. When trying to synthesize the code, there was an error in the testbench module. The testbench had two initial statements. The first initial statement housed the error of loop count limit exceeded forever never breaks. This is because the AI had setup the clock with the following code:\ninitial begin\n    clk = 0;\n    forever #5 clk = ~clk;\nend\nThis block of code is notably different from how I implement a clock. I use an always statement instead of initial to setup the clock.\nJust attempting to synthesize without including the testbench in implementation does work! Looking at theseven_seg_decoder module from the AI, the case statement looks like mine, accomodating for the common anode by having 1 as LOW and 0 as HIGH for the display. There is however no default case which could be a problem for debugging. The seven_seg_mux module uses the same clock divider setup as the provided example on the E155 website by using a counter and setting the multiplexer’s select to the last bit. What’s more strikingly different is that the input multiplexer code is an always_comb statement whereas I used the syntax for a multiplexer of select ? in1:in0. The AI also used an always_ff statement for the output demultiplexer with latches by turning the output to either all segments off or all segments on. However, we were told explicitly not to use latches and to use PNP transistors to control the anode power.\n\n\nWith Lab 1 Files Provided\nWith the Lab 1 files provided, the AI did not provide a testbench. The code was much shorter than without the Lab 1 files. The code does use HSOSC immediately which is different from the Lab 1 AI Prototype. For the time multiplexing, the AI created a clock divider to toggle at 1200 Hz. This seems a little high to me as a computer screen is around 60 Hz. Such high frequency could cause some bleeding between digits. The code for the multiplexer select is how I did the select in my code where the counter resets and the mux select switches to its opposite logic after a certain number of counts. The input multiplexer code was still an always_comb statement rather than the select ? in1:in0 format. The code then uses my sevensegment module to input the switch chosen from the always_comb statement and outputs the segments to turn on. The AI this time uses an always_comb for the output demultiplexer to use the multiplexer select from the clock divider to choose whether to make the first digit active and the second display off or vice versa. The default display is that both displays are off.\nThe code also provides a small section to use LEDs to check which display is active, check when the two inputs differ, and to blink at the frequency of the clock divider.\nOverall, I think both codes are very high quality although may be a little wordy considering mux logic can be much shorter than an always_comb statement. The code was interesting to compare as we didn’t specify to the AI to send an output to PNP transistors to control which digit was on and I think the prototype had a clever way of sending the output to the LED segments."
