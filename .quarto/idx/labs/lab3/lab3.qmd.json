To alternate between the two, the on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz then a counter was used to divide the high frequency clock signal into a 60 Hz signal.\n\n![The calculation for the counter to make the inputs and output powers alternate at 60 Hz.](images/lab2_countercalc.jpg){#fig-countercalc}\n\nThe calculation in @fig-countercalc derived that the counter needed to reach 200000 before setting the multiplexer select HIGH in order switch between the two inputs and turning on the two outputs at 60 Hz. For example, if the first digit should read 1 and then second digit should read 5, then when `clk` is `LOW`, the program takes 1 as the input and sends 1 to both digits' outputs. Then, the program turns only the first digit's power on and turns the other digit's power off. When `clk` is `HIGH`, the program takes 5 as the input and sends 5 to both digits' outputs. Then the program turns the second digit's power on and turns the first digit's power off. This switch happens fast enough that the human eye sees both individual digits on the display. \n\n### Resistor choice for 7-segment Display\n![The calculation for the 7-segment current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 1.9V from the MAN4600 datasheet.](images/lab2_sevsegcalc.jpg){#fig-sevsegcalc}\n\nThe calculation in @fig-sevsegcalc derived 1k立 as an appropriate resistor to provide ~1.2 mA to the LED segments of the 7-segment display. The drop in voltage from the emitter is due to the emitter saturation voltage. Thus the voltage going into the segment displays is 3.1 V. \n\n### Resistor choice for transistors\n![The calculation for the transistor current-limiting resistors using a V_f of 0.7V for the emitter diode such that the base voltage is 2.6V.](images/lab2_transcalc.jpg){#fig-transcalc}\n\nThe calculation in @fig-transcalc derived 2.7k立 as an appropriate resistor (stock-room available) to provide less than 1 mA to FPGA I/O pins.\n\n### Resistor choice for keypad inputs\nIn order to read the keypad keys, I chose to have my columns as one of my `top` module's outputs. This means my program drives power to the columns and checks the rows for a press. I also chose to implement an active `HIGH` keypad, which means I needed pulldown resistors for the row inputs such that when there is no activity, the rows read `4'b0000`. I chose 680立 as the resistors to be large enough so as to not draw too much current from the FPGA pins and small enough to quickly pull down the signal and act as a pulldown resistor. \n\n### Debounce design and FSM diagrams\nOne of the mechanical issues with the keypad buttons is that the buttons \"bounce\" when pressed. I chose to debounce my keypad buttons using an 3-state FSM that waits for a button to be pressed, then when the button was pressed the FSM would enter a state that waits for a counter to reach high enough that the button would have stabilized, then when the counter reaches a set number the FSM would enter a state that waits for the button to be released.\n\n![Scanner FSM state transition diagram and state transition table.](images/lab3_scanfsm.jpg){#fig-scanfsm}\n![Debouncer and Digit FSM state transition diagram and state transition table.](images/lab3_debdigfsm.jpg){#fig-tbdebdigfsm}\n\nThe images above detail the design of the three FSMs that I used in my overall implementation. One FSM was to switch between scanning for rows and holding when a key was pressed (@fig-scanfsm). Another FSM was the debouncing FSM to only register the keypress once (@fig-tbdebdigfsm). And the digit FSM was for switching between updating the digits and not updating the digits (@fig-tbdebdigfsm). The FSM is a simple strategy to store an input in \"memory\" and use this memory to decide what to do at the next clock cycle. However, some of the tradeoffs with the FSM is that the inputs and timing can get really tricky especially in this lab where multiple FSMs needed to communicate with each other. \n\n## Technical Documentation\nThe source code for the project can be found in the associated [Github repository](https://github.com/erinlywang/e155-lab3)\n\n### Block Diagram\n![Block diagram showing the top module and the submodules `HSOSC`, `scanner`, `debouncer`, `synchronizer`, `digit, `keypad`, `mpx`, and `sevseg`.](images/lab3_block.jpg){#fig-block}\n\nThe block diagram in @fig-block demonstrates the overall architecture of the design. The top-level module `top` includes 8 submodules: the high-speed oscillator block (`HSOSC`), the scanner to check for keypad presses, the debouncer to debounce the button presses, the synchronizer to synchronizer the `row` and `col` signals, the digit module to send the debounced signal either to the right digit and send the previous right digit to the left digit, the keypad module to decode a `row` and `col` pair into a key on the keypad, and finally the multiplexer to alternate at 60 Hz (`mpx`) and the 7-segment display module from Lab 1 (`sevseg`). \n\n## Schematic\n![Schematic of the layout not including the the reset button (P43). The diodes of each digit of the 7-segment display share a common anode.](images/lab3_schematic.jpg){#fig-schematic}\n\n@fig-schematic shows the physical layout of the design. The output 7-segment diodes were connected using a 1k立 current-limiting resistor to ensure the output current (~1.4 mA) did not exceed the maximum output current of the FPGA I/O pins. The figure also shows which pin number of the dual display corresponds to which segment (i.e. A1,A2,B1, B2...) of the 7-segment display.\n\n![Diagram of the letter assignment for the 7-segment display.](images/seven_seg_map.png){#fig-sevsegletters}\n\n@fig-sevsegletters depicts the assignment of letters to a digit of the output display. In the program, seg[0] corresponds to a, seg[1] to b, and so on. \n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### Testbench Simulation\n#### `top` Module (`HSOSC` implied)\n![Testbench simulation results for top module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts](images/lab3_tbtop.png){#fig-tbtop}\n\nThe design met all intended design objectives. @fig-tbtop shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the `top` module's testbench `tb_top`. Because all the outputs depend on `HSOSC` it can be assumed that `HSOSC` toggles. As shown in @fig-tbtop, the simulated outputs of `seg` change when expected in relation to the `led0` which holds the value for whether the button is debounced and `counter` from the `mpx` module which updates what key to send to the `seg` module. `seg` is expected then to change after the button is debounced (db/counter reaches 500000) and the mpx sends `seg` the key to output (db/mpx reaches 200000). I wrote tests for all 16 keys that `seg` matches expected for when the button is pressed, when another button is pressed while the first one is still pressed, and when the button is released. Although not pictured, the testbench passed all tests for all 16 keys. \n\n#### `scanner` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for scanner module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts](images/lab3_tbscanner.png){#fig-tbscanner}\n\n@fig-tbscanner shows that the `scanner` module reaches all scanning states when no row is input and reaches all pressed states when a row is input at the corresponding column. At the end of the simulation, the image shows that the scanner module also correctly stays in the PRESSED state even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held. \n\n#### `debouncer` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for debouncer module. The simulation shows the correct states as expected with the set inputs.](images/lab3_tbdebouncerS1.png){#fig-tbdebouncerS1}\n\n@fig-tbdebouncerS1 shows that the `debouncer` module moves from S0 (waiting for key press) to S1 when a key is registered and correctly stays in the S1 state of waiting for `debounced` to go high (`counter` to reach 500000) even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held. \n\n![Testbench simulation results for debouncer module. The simulation shows the correct states as expected with the set inputs.](images/lab3_tbdebouncerS2.png){#fig-tbdebouncerS2}\n\n@fig-tbdebouncerS2 shows that the `debouncer` module moves from S1 (waiting for `debounced`) to S2 when `debounced` goes high and stays in the S2 state of waiting for the button to be released even when a new input key is pressed while the first key is held. The FSM also correctly moves back to S0 when the button is released (`row` input is `4'b0000`). `debounced` also correctly goes high after the counter counts up to 500000.\n\n#### `synchronizer` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for synchronizer module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts.](images/lab3_tbsync.png){#fig-tbsync}\n@fig-tbsync shows that the `synchronizer` module correctly transfers the asynchronous input to the synchronized output after 4 clock cycles. The choice of 4 clock cycles was for the synchronized output to match the right SCANNING state in the `scanner` module, and there are 4 scanning states to run through in the scanning cycle. \n\n#### `digit` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for digit module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts.](images/lab3_tbdigit.png){#fig-tbdigit}\n@fig-tbdigit shows that the `digit` module visits all 3 states. The module correctly does not transfer any information when in the `NOUPDATE` state and correctly transfers the most recent input only to the right row/col and updates the left row/col with the previous values of the right row/col in the `UPDATE` state. The module also correctly only updates the right and left rows/cols by moving to the `FINISHEDUPDATE` state after updating once as well as returns to `NOUPDATE` when the `debounced` signal goes back to 0 (`debouncer` module is back to waiting for a button to be pressed).\n\n#### `keypad` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for keypad module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts.](images/lab3_tbkeypad.png){#fig-tbkeypad}\n@fig-tbkeypad shows that the `keypad` module correctly matches a row and column pair to its corresponding key on the 4x4 keypad.\n\n#### `sevseg` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for the sevseg module. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all testvectors](images/lab2_tbsevseg.png){#fig-tbsevseg}\n\n@fig-tbsevseg shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the `sevseg` module's testbench `tb_sevseg`. The simulated outputs of `seg` match the expected outputs. \n\n#### `mpx` Module\n![Testbench simulation results for the mpx module for before the flip. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all asserts](images/lab2_tbmpxCOUNTLOW.png){#fig-tbmpx0}\n\n@fig-tbmpx0 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the `mpx` module's testbench `tb_mpx` to test that the `s`, `trans0`, and `trans1` output matches the expected outputs for before the alternation (aka flip) at `counter = 200000`. Because we are before the flip, `s` should be the same as the `s0` input and `trans0` and `trans1` should be 0 and 1 respectively. The simulated outputs of `mpx` match the expected outputs for before the flip and the counter is counting up. \n\n![Testbench simulation results for the mpx module for after the flip. The simulation shows outputs match expected outputs for all testvectors](images/lab2_tbmpxCOUNTHIGH.png){#fig-tbmpx1}\n\n@fig-tbmpx1 shows a screenshot of the QuestaSim simulation for the `mpx` module's testbench `tb_mpx` to test that the `s`, `trans0`, and `trans1` output matches the expected outputs for after the alternation (aka flip) that should occur when the counter reaches 200000. Because we are after the flip, `s` should be the same as the `s1` input and `trans0` and `trans1` should be 1 and 0 respectively. The simulated outputs of `mpx` match the expected outputs for after the flip and the flip happens when the counter reaches 200000. The reset of the counter after `count` reaches 200000 is also visualized.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe design successfully read inputs from the 4x4 keypad and displayed the most recent input on the right digit of a dual 7-segment display and the last input on the left digit. The design does not lock up when multiple buttons are pressed. Each button press is only registered once and the 7-segment displays are the same brightness. The design has no latchesor tristate buffers. The design also uses synchronizers and only registers the first button press if additional buttons are pressed down while holding down one button. There is no bleeding between the digits or flickering and the 7-segment display does not dim depending on which numbers are displayed. The digits are also upright to the viewer. \n\nOverall a success!\n\n## AI Prototype and Reflection\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Lab Hours\nI spent 60 hours on this lab.\n\n## Introduction\nLab 3 involved learning how to synchronize asynchronous inputs from a 4x4 keypad and use FSMs for memory to display the most recent input from the keypad as the right digit of a dual 7-segment display and the last input as the left digit. \n\n## Design and Testing Methodology\n\n### Dual Display with one 7-Segment Module\nIn order to display two independent hexadecimal numbers on the dual 7-segment display using only one `sevseg` module, the trick was to send the same output to both digits but alternate between turning on the first digit and the second digit fast enough that the different digits are seen at the same time to our eyes (~60 Hz).
